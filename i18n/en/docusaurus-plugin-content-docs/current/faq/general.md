## Usage

### How does the progression system work?

TrioSigno's progression system works on several levels:

- **Mastery level**: Each sign you learn has a mastery level between 0 and 100%
- **XP (experience points)**: You earn XP by completing lessons, exercises, and reviews
- **User level**: Your overall level increases as you accumulate XP
- **Badges and achievements**: You unlock badges by reaching certain goals

The system uses a spaced repetition algorithm to remind you to review signs at the optimal time for long-term memorization.

### How does sign recognition work?

Sign recognition in TrioSigno works through a specially trained artificial intelligence model:

1. The camera captures your movements in real-time
2. The AI model analyzes the position of your hands, fingers, and sometimes facial expressions
3. The algorithm compares your movements with reference models for each sign
4. The system evaluates the accuracy of your sign and provides immediate feedback

For best results, make sure you are in a well-lit environment and properly positioned facing the camera.

### Can I use TrioSigno without an internet connection?

TrioSigno requires an internet connection for most of its features, especially for sign recognition which uses an online AI model. However, some basic features are available offline:

- Consultation of the previously downloaded sign dictionary
- Review of already loaded lessons
- Viewing of already cached videos

We are currently working on a version with more extensive offline capabilities.

### How do I track my progress?

To track your progress:

1. Log in to your TrioSigno account
2. Access the personal dashboard from the main menu
3. View progress charts and statistics
4. See your mastered signs and those requiring more practice
5. Check your activity calendar to see your learning regularity
6. Review badges and achievements you have unlocked
